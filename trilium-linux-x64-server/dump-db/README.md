# Trilium Notes DB dump tool

This is a simple tool to dump the content of Trilium's document.db onto filesystem.

It is meant as a last resort solution when the standard mean to access your data (through main Trilium application) fail.

## Installation

This tool requires node.js, testing has been done on 16.18.0, but it will probably work on other versions as well.

```
npm install
```

## Running

See output of `node dump-db.js --help`:

```
dump-db.js <path_to_document> <target_directory>

dump the contents of document.db into the target directory

Positionals:
path_to_document  path to the document.db
target_directory  path of the directory into which the notes should be dumped
